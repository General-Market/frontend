# General Market

> Decentralized protocol for on-chain index products and prediction markets.

General Market enables users to create, trade, and manage tokenized index tracking products (ITPs) and trade on Vision, a sealed parimutuel prediction market. The protocol runs on an Arbitrum Orbit L3 chain. ITPs work like ETFs — each holds a fixed basket of crypto assets whose NAV floats with underlying prices. Vision lets traders bet on binary price outcomes (UP/DOWN) across batches of assets with configurable tick durations.

## Key Features

- **Index Tracking Products (ITPs)**: Tokenized baskets of up to 100 crypto assets with real-time NAV pricing
- **Buy & Sell**: On-chain order submission with BLS-consensus batching and CEX execution via Authorized Participants
- **Create Custom ITPs**: Define asset weights, deploy your own index product in one transaction
- **Lending (Morpho)**: Deposit USDC to earn yield, or borrow against ITP shares as collateral
- **Backtesting**: Simulate portfolio performance with historical data before deploying
- **Vision (Prediction Market)**: Sealed parimutuel prediction market — bet on binary price outcomes (UP/DOWN) across batches of assets with configurable tick durations and resolution types

## Architecture

- **Chain**: Arbitrum Orbit L3 (Chain ID: 111222333)
- **Consensus**: BLS signature aggregation (BN254 curve, 2/3 threshold)
- **Settlement**: 1-second cycles with 5 phases (Collect → Propose → Sign → Confirm → Rebalance)
- **Execution**: Authorized Participants execute trades on Bitget with 0.1% price tolerance
- **Collateral**: USDC (18 decimals)
